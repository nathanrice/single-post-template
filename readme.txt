Single Post Template adds the ability for your theme to include "Post Templates" in much the same way you can add "Page Templates", allowing you to choose (via a simple dropdown) which post template you want to use, on a per-post basis.

== Description ==

The Single Post Template plugin adds the ability for your theme to include "Post Templates" in much the same way you can add "Page Templates", allowing you to choose (via a simple dropdown) which post template you want to use, on a per-post basis.

All you need to do, after installing and activating the plugin, is create one or more "Post Templates" in your theme's folder, and when creating or editing a post, choose the post template that you would like to use. If no post template is selected, the default template will be used.

== Installation ==

**Installation**

1. Upload the entire `single-post-template` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create Post Templates in your theme's folder, as described in Usage

**Usage**

After you have installed the plugin, you'll need to create some Post Templates to use. In order to create a Post Template, either duplicate your default single post template, or create a new template file. Insert the following code at the very top of the file:

`
<?php
/*
Single Post Template: [Descriptive Template Name]
Description: This part is optional, but helpful for describing the Post Template
*/
?>
`

*See Screenshot #1 for what this might look like in your code editor*

Once you have created a new Post Template, either edit or create a new post, and directly underneath the post content box, you should see a new box labeled "Single Post Template". Choose the Post Template you want to use and publish or update the post.

*See Screenshot #2 for what this might look like in your post edit screen*
